# rock-paper-scissors.js
This project is a simple implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript. The player can choose one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer will randomly select its choice. The game determines the winner based on the choices made by the player and the computer and updates the scores accordingly.
